# Official API Documentation

Plex has released official API documentation here: <https://developer.plex.tv/>

## Unofficial Plex API Documentation
This repositories Wiki was intended to be a place to document what is discovered of the Plex.tv API, since there was no official documentation at the time.

The archive of this work can be found over in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Arcanemagus/plex-api/wiki).
